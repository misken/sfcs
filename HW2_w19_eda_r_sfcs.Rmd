## Step 1 - Familiarize yourself with the data and the assignment

In this assignment you'll do some exploratory data analysis
with R on a dataset about airline flights out of Detroit Metropolitan
Airport. The focus will be on basic statistics and basic plots. See the README.md file (it's just a plain text file with markdown in it) for details about the data file. 

As we did in class, you'll be creating an R Markdown document to
both prepare a dataset and do some analysis as well as to document the
steps you did (and answer some questions I'll throw at you).

You'll notice a few "Hacker Extra" tasks
thrown in. These are for those of you who want to go a little above and beyond
and attempt some more challenging tasks. And, feel free to do a some free form
Hacker Extra style work yourself - in other words, do something beyond what
was asked. You'll learn more.

## Step 2 - R Markdown document

You'll put your answers right into this document. Make sure 
you have simply extracted the .tar.gz file for the assignment
into the location of your choice. It contains a folder named
/hw2_f18_eda_r.

This will be your working directory. 

## Step 3 - Set working directory and explore data folder

Set the working directory. You'll notice that there is a folder named **data**.
Inside of it you'll find the data file for this assignment - **flights_DTW_2017.csv**.


## Step 4 - Complete the following R tasks and answer questions

Now you'll need to complete the following tasks in R. Just like we did in class, you should
use a combination of markdown text (be concise, no need to write tons of text) 
to explain what you are doing and R code chunks to actually do it.
When you are done, use the "Knit" button to generate an HTML file from your R Markdown.
You'll be submitting BOTH the completed R Markdown file as well as the generated HTML file.

Let's load a few libraries we'll need:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```


### Problem 1 - Get the data into a dataframe

You should read the data into a `data.frame` named `flights_out`.

```{r read_flights}
#flights_out <- read.csv(????)

```

Check the structure of the `data.frame`.

```{r flights_structure}
#???
```

### Problem 2 - Fix the FL_DATE field

The FL_DATE field was interpeted as a factor. Convert it to
a POSIXct date type. After doing this, use the `class` function to show that your
change was successful and show the first 20 rows of the updated field.

A few suggestions:

- Don't try to change the field type in place until you know for sure your approach works. Do the conversion into a new field instead. Call this new
field FL_DATE_2. After you've got it working, you can "remove" the FL_DATE_2
column by subsetting the flights dataframe to grab all the rows and all the
columns except FL_DATE_2.
- help() is useful

```{r fixFL_DATE}
#flights_out$FL_DATE_2 <- ????
#flights_out$FL_DATE <- flights$FL_DATE_2
#flights_out <- flights[????]

# Additional commands...

```

### Problem 3 - Basic summary stats

Let's explore overall departure delays.

Compute the following statistics for departure delay (DEP_DELAY).

* mean, median, 5% trimmed mean
* range, standard deviation, coefficient of variation
* 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th quantiles

```{r depdel_stats}
# Bunch of commands ...

```



What fraction of flights are delayed by more than one hour?

```{r}
# Can be done with one line
```

A related measure to delay is called "tardiness". Tardiness is the
max(0, DEP_DELAY). Create a new column called DEP_TARDINESS and
then compute the mean tardiness. Compare to mean departure delay.

```{r}
#flights_out$DEP_TARDINESS <- ???
#mean(flights_out$DEP_TARDINESS)
```


### Problem 4 - Basic plots for air time

Create a histogram, boxplot, kernel density plot and violin plot for
AIR_TIME.

Histogram

```{r gg_histo1}
# ggplot(data = ???) + 
#   ???
```

Kernel density plot
```{r gg_density1}

```

Box plot
```{r gg_box1}
# ggplot(???) + 
#   geom_boxplot(aes(x="AIR_TIME", y=???))
```

Violin plot
```{r gg_violin1}

```

Now redo histograms and facet by carrier (OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER).

```{r gg_histo_facet}

```

Write a short paragraph describing the distribution of AIR_TIME based
on the plots you've created. What are some shortcomings of boxplots
in this example?

Here's something more challening:

Also create a kernel density plot overlaid on a histogram. 
Include vertical lines for the mean and median of air time. 
Here's what I created.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./histo_kdens.png")
```


### Problem 5 - Exploring departure delay

Let's start by creating a histogram of departure delay and then a
scatter plot of DEP_TIME on X axis and DEP_DELAY on Y axis. Any
ideas on why the scatter plot looks like it does?

```{r gg_histo1_depdelay}
# ???
```


```{r gg_scatter1_depdelay}
# ggplot(flights_out) + 
#   geom_point(???)
```


### Problem 6 - Total number of flights out of DTW by destination

Count the number of flights by destination airport (DEST). 

Several ways you could do this.

Use `table()`.

```{r num_out}
# table(???)
```

Use **dplyr** and sort descending by number of flights.

```{r num_out_soln}
# flights_out %>%
#   ??? %>%
#   summarise(???) %>% 
#   ???)
```



### Problem 7 - Summary statistics for departure delay by carrier

Use **dplyr** to compute the following statistics
for departure delay grouped by carrier.

* number of flights 
* mean
* 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th quantiles

Sort the results in descending order by number of flights. Does carrier
appear to impact departure delays?


```{r stats_by_carrier}
# ???
```


### Problem 8 - Boxplots for departure delay by carrier

Use **ggplot2** to create a plot showing departure delay by carrier boxplots.
Comment on the resulting plot. Then try to make improvements so that you can
focus on the boxes better - outliers making this difficult in original plot.

```{r bp_carrier}
# ggplot(flights_out) +
#   geom_boxplot(aes(x=???, y=???))
```




### Problem 9 - Engineer new features to facilitate time of day analysis

Create a new field called CRS_DEP_HOUR based on CRS_DEP_TIME.
Check it by displaying the first 10 rows and the CRS_DEP_HOUR and
CRS_DEP_TIME fields.

```{r crs_dep_hour}
# flights_out$CRS_DEP_HOUR <- ??? 
# flights_out[???, ???]

```

In addition, you decide that you'd like to create a "coarser" version 
based on "departure period". Let's call it CRS_DEP_PRD. The values 
of this new variable are as follows:

1 if CRS_DEP_HOUR in [6,12]
2 if CRS_DEP_HOUR in [13,18]
3 if CRS_DEP_HOUR in [19,23]
4 if CRS_DEP_HOUR in [0,5]

See http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Recoding_data/ for ideas. After
creating the departure period field, makes sure you convert it to a factor if
it's not already. Hint: 

```{r crs_dep_prd}


```



Finally, create a field FL_DOW based on FL_DATE representing 
the (integer) day of week of the flight. The **lubridate** package will be helpful.

```{r fl_dow}


```



### Problem 10 - Do group by analysis on CRS_DEP_PRD

Are departure delays related to departure period? Start by computing 
basic summary statistics for DEP_DELAY by CRS_DEP_PRD. Of course you already know how to do this from previous questions in this assignment. 

Use **dplyr**.

```{r}
# ddelay_period_summary <- flights_out %>% 
#   group_by(???) %>% 
#   summarise(
#       num_flights=???,
#       ???,
#       ...
#       ???)
# 
# head(ddelay_period_summary)
# tail(ddelay_period_summary)
```

### Problem 11 - A scatterplot of DEP_DELAY by CRS_DEP_HOUR

Create two versions, a standard scatter plot and one with "jitter". 

Jitter is useful when you have many duplicate points that obscure each other.

```{r}
ggplot(flights_out) + geom_point(aes(x=CRS_DEP_HOUR,y=DEP_DELAY)) + ggtitle("No jitter")

ggplot(flights_out) + ???) + ggtitle("With jitter")
```

### Problem 12 - Are departure delays related to day of week? What about by month of year?

Use plots and/or group by analysis to take a first look at these questions.

```{r delay_dow}


```

```{r delay_month}


```

### Problem 13 - Bar charts

Create a basic bar chart based on number of flights by Carrier.

```{r basic_bar}

```

Now create a similar plot but instead of the bars being based on
counts, make it be the mean AIR_TIME. The key is
to base your plot on the result of a group by operation using **dplyr**. Hint: You'll
also want to learn about the `stat` layer in ggplots.

This is a general strategy that is often useful for complex charts - create an intermediate dataframe that will make it "easy" to create the chart. Tools like **dplyr** (or **plyr** or **apply** family) are
often a good choice for creating the intermediate dataframe.

For an additional challenge, try to order the bars so longest bars first.

```{r adv_bar}

```



### Hacker Extra - Number of flights by day of week

Compute the average number of flights by day of week by carrier. Be careful. This is trickier than it seems.

HINT: Let's start by computing flights by date by carrier.

```{r}
#??? ... bunch of commands
```



### Hacker Extra - Do some more analysis

Try a few things on your own to learn more about flights out of DTW. :)
